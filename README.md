**Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mock-Up Design**

-Identifying design properties such as colors, typography, and spacing helps maintain visual consistency across all pages.

-It allows developers to accurately translate the Figma mock-up into code and ensures the final product looks and feels like the original design.

-It also improves collaboration between designers and developers, reduces rework, and creates a more professional, user-friendly interface.

**Why Identify Design Properties:**  
They ensure consistency, improve collaboration, and help match Figma mockups accurately.
