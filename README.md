### 💡 Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying design properties like color, typography, and spacing helps maintain **visual consistency** across all pages.  
It ensures that developers and designers speak the same visual language.  
By understanding the Figma mockup’s design system, front-end developers can:
- Recreate the same look and feel in code  
- Improve user experience through consistent design  
- Reduce confusion and rework during development  
- Build reusable components that follow the same style guide
